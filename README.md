Guess the 5-letter secret word in 6 tries.
 After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was:

ðŸŸ© Green = correct letter in the correct spot  
ðŸŸ¨ Gold = correct letter but in the wrong spot  
â¬œ Gray = letter not in the word at all

Can you guess the word before you run out of tries?


 Background info of the game is a nice touch.
