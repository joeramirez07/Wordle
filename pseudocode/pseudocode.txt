Init
- Randomly select a secretWord from the WORDS array.
- Convert secretWord into an array of characters using .split('') and store as a new state variable secretWordArr.
- Set currentGuess to an empty string.
- Set guesses array to empty.
- Set currentRow to 0.
- Set gameOver to false.
- Build an empty game board (30 tiles: 6 rows Ã— 5 tiles).
- Call render() to update the initial empty board.

Handling Keyboard Button Clicks (handleKeyboardClick)
- If the game is over, ignore all input.
- Get the clicked button's textContent (the letter).
- If the letter is:
  - A single letter (A-Z):
    - Call addLetter(letter).
  - The word "DELETE":
    - Call deleteLetter().
  - The word "ENTER":
    - Call submitGuess().
- After any input, call render() to update the screen.

Typing Letters (addLetter)
- If currentGuess length is less than 5:
  - Append the chosen letter to currentGuess.
- If currentGuess is already 5 letters, ignore additional typing.
- Always call render() after updating currentGuess.

Deleting Letters (deleteLetter)
- Remove the last letter from currentGuess (slice off the last character).
- Always call render() after updating currentGuess.

Submitting a Guess (submitGuess)
- Only allow submission if currentGuess is exactly 5 letters.
- Add currentGuess to the guesses array.
- Compare currentGuess to secretWord:
  - If they match:
    - Set gameOver to true.
    - Display "You Win!" message.
  - Else:
    - If this was the 6th guess (MAX_GUESSES):
      - Set gameOver to true.
      - Display "You Lose!" message and reveal secretWord.
    - Otherwise:
      - Increment currentRow by 1.
      - Clear currentGuess to empty.
- Always call render() after submitting a guess.

Rendering the Board (render)
- Clear the board container visually.
- For each guess already made:
  - Loop through each letter:
    - Fill each tile with the letter.
    - Apply a color:
      - Green if the letter is correct and in the correct position.
      - Yellow if the letter is correct but wrong position.
      - Gray if the letter is not in the word.
- For the current typing guess:
  - Show typed letters in tiles (no colors yet).

Helper Details
- Use .split('') to break words into arrays for easier letter checking.
- Use .join('') if you need to rebuild words from arrays.
- Always call render() after any state change.

Summary Timeline
1. Write initialize()
2. Call initialize() when page loads
3. Write empty render() function
4. Always call render() after changes to state
5. Register keyboard event listeners using event delegation
6. Write logic for typing, deleting, submitting guesses
