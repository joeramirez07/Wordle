1. Start the Game
- Pick a random secret word from the list.
- Reset guesses, current row, and game status to starting values.
- Build the empty board of tiles.

2. When Player Clicks a Button
- If they click a letter, add it to the current guess (up to 5 letters).
- If they click DELETE, remove the last letter typed.
- If they click ENTER, try to submit the guess.

3. Submitting a Guess
- Only allow submitting if the guess has exactly 5 letters.
- If the guess matches the secret word, the player wins.
- If it's wrong but guesses remain, move to the next row.
- If no guesses are left, the player loses.

4. Typing Letters
- Allow typing up to 5 letters only.
- Update the tiles each time a letter is typed or deleted.

5. Rendering the Board
- Show all submitted guesses in the tiles.
- Color the tiles green, yellow, or gray based on the guess.
- Show the current guess being typed (without colors yet).
 6. Helper Tools
- Use split() to break words into arrays for easy checking.
- Always call render() after changing any game state.

 Important Rule
- Always update (render) the board after typing, deleting, or submitting a guess!
